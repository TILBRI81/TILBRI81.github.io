### Hello, Guten Tag, Ciao, Bonjour, Hola!

**Welcome to my blog (it’s still a big work in progress)**

If you’re on my site, you’re probably looking to jack up your online privacy and security and in search of some alternatives to the big tech services we’ve all used for many years.

In today’s day and age, it’s so important we protect our freedom of privacy, and our personal matters and communications remain private! Unfortunately, if you use any online service like Gmail, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook (just to name a few) you are being tracked, your data is getting mined, and they have a much deeper reach into your life and your activities than you could ever imagine. The amount of information they gather, sell for profits, and know about you is scary!

While using online services has become a common and integrated part of our daily lives there are some changes we can make to protect our privacy – an important one is changing your email provider. After all, email is a formal means of communication that we use for sharing personal and private information with others. 

The first thing we need to do to ensure our private messages remain private and aren’t scanned is to use an email provider that has [end-to-end encryption](https://tuta.com/encryption) by default. While Gmail and Outlook have been labeled the gold standard for emails amongst your everyday user, unaware of their tactics and business models. These email providers scan the contents of your emails and have a deep reach into your personal life.  

My personal favourite, go-to email provider that I always recommend to friends, family and my online community is [Tuta Mail](https://tuta.com/) Tuta Mail (formerly Tutanota) is an end-to-end encrypted email provider and calendar service. I love them because first of all, it’s FREE, there’s no app tracking or advertising and its end-to-end encrypted so I know that literally no one can read my private emails or snoop about my mailbox or calendar. In my opinion, Tuta Mail is the [best Gmail alternative](https://tuta.com/gmail-alternative) – especially if you’re looking for a free privacy-focused mailbox. 

Another great privacy-focused email provider is Proton Mail. They also offer end-to-end encrypted emails by default. Also a popular choice amongst the online privacy community, but for me Tuta Mail still wins me over. Proton Mail loves to ride the fame wave of being built in Switzerland, and use the illusion of ['Swiss Privacy’](https://tuta.com/blog/swiss-privacy-is-an-illusion) for their marketing – Don’t get me wrong, it has good privacy and security, but Tuta Mail still has an edge above them. If you’d like to see how Tuta Mail and Proton Mail compare, here’s a [guide to their key differences.](https://tuta.com/best-protonmail-alternative/) 

I’ve mentioned two email providers briefly, but there are many other privacy-focused mail providers out there. If you’d like to see a comprehensive guide to other privacy focused email providers, [click here!]( https://tuta.com/blog/best-private-email-service)
